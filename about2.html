                        <h5 class="card-title">KRATOS</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Following the ending of God of War II, God of War III picks up directly
                            after this with a stirring opening narration from Zeus discussing the actions of the rogue
                            Kratos, the God of War, who is 'commanding' a small army of Titans rescued from the Great
                            War (using the power of the Fates). The Olympians immediately rush to battle; Helios rides
                            on his chariot over Olympus, Hermes speeds down the very peaks of Olympus as Zeus watches
                            on, Hercules receives the order to lead his troops down into the fray, Hades lunges off and
                            engages several Titans in his giant form, and Poseidon (using his aquakinesis) shoots down
                            from Olympus like a missile and performs a death blow through the chest of Epimetheus, and
                            then manifests himself as a massive water being and spawns several water horses called
                            Hippocampi to aid in the battle. With Poseidon as their greatest threat in the battle,
                            having already decimated numerous Titans and soon going after Gaia herself, Kratos engages
                            the God of the Sea and after drawing him into Gaia's grasp manages to knock a weakened
                            Poseidon out of his godly form and onto a separate platform. The two quarrel with each other
                            briefly before Kratos walks up and beats the Lord of the Sea savagely, finally gouging out
                            his eyes and snapping his neck before he tosses him into the ocean. With Poseidon's death,
                            the seas cataclysm and ocean levels rise significantly, causing a flood that appears to
                            engulf the entire world and destroying almost all of mankind save those on top of Olympia.

                            After killing Poseidon, Kratos and Gaia reach Zeus' pavilion, where the king of the gods
                            angrily anticipates Kratos' arrival and, at last, assaults them with a mighty blast of
                            lightning that blows off a massive amount of Gaia's arm and sends the two spiraling down
                            Olympus (Kratos survives presumably by using the Golden Fleece to absorb most of the blast).
                            However, even using the Blade of Olympus to stab into her back, Kratos is unable to hang on
                            as Gaia fights to survive and climb back up to Zeus. She warns him that he was only a pawn
                            and is now expendable now that the Titans have reached Zeus, allowing the embittered Spartan
                            to tumble to his death. Kratos contemplates his life as he lurches through the River Styx
                            and its caverns, and resolves to escape Hades (once again) and destroy Zeus. On his way to
                            Hades' chamber after being sucked of nearly all of his power from the dead souls of Styx, he
                            reunites with a newly-formed Athena who claims to have reached a "new level of existence"
                            and is willing to help Kratos assume his revenge, granting him new weapons to survive the
                            Underworld and the foes that lie ahead, and also defining his next quest of finding and
                            extinguishing the Flame of Olympus in order to truly defeat Zeus.

                            Kratos makes his way through the Underworld meeting a couple of lost souls, encountering
                            statues of the judges of the Underworld, meeting Hephaestus who informs him more and more
                            about the secrets of Olympus and Zeus, and finding mysterious scrawls on the ground that he
                            silently acknowledges to be from various people in his past. Finally entering Hades' palace
                            he finds the coffin-wed body of Persephone that Hades had restored, and engages the Lord of
                            the Underworld himself inside of a dark cavern. Hades matches Kratos until the bloodthirsty
                            Spartan manages to rip off his helmet and steal his weapons, and then ripping out Hades' own
                            soul and absorbs it using the Claws of Hades. Escaping the Underworld through a Hyperion
                            Gate, Kratos renews his journey up along Olympus except that he now faces both the Titans
                            and the Gods - he encounters Helios on his chariot where later he rips the sun god's head
                            off with his bare hands and receives the Head of Helios, he 'amputates' the legs of Hermes
                            acquiring the Boots of Hermes, mercilessly beats his own half-brother Hercules to death with
                            the Nemean Cestus, breaks Hera's neck after she insults Pandora, a small childlike creation
                            of Hephaestus who is the key to extinguishing the Flame of Olympus and revealing its
                            contents, encountering a radiant Aphrodite and her handmaidens in the goddess' chamber,
                            stabbing the Titan Cronos in the head with the Blades of Olympus at Tartarus, impaling
                            Hephaestus after betraying Kratos to Cronos, receiving the Nemesis Whip from Hephaestus just
                            before his death, battles Skorpius, The Queen of the Scorpions and finally arriving at the
                            Flame's chamber with Pandora, only to be interrupted by Zeus himself.

                            Zeus prevents Pandora from her destiny, the battle between the God of War and the King of
                            the Gods began, Kratos bests the King of the Gods in a duel and suddenly has a change of
                            heart. Pandora was made to be the Key to Pandora's Box, which is what truly rests within the
                            Flame of Olympus, and would have to sacrifice herself. However, due to inadvertent prodding
                            from Zeus pleads that Kratos not to "fail her like he failed his family", Kratos releases
                            Pandora and attacks Zeus in extreme rage, only to be stunned by the Flame's dissipation.
                            Kratos opens the Box once again, just as he had in the first game, only to discover that it
                            is empty. Zeus mocks him for "another failure", and teleports outside in order to recover,
                            while Kratos' rage grows even stronger. Father and son meet outside once again on a familiar
                            platform, but before either can claim victory, the platform is suddenly shaken by a
                            reawakened Gaia (believed to have been killed during the fight and subject of many Titans
                            anger against Kratos), who violently shakes them and causes them to flee inside of her body.
                            Inside of her chest, Kratos and Zeus duel near her heart; Zeus sucks her heart of her life
                            and rejuvenates as does Kratos, and finally, Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against
                            her heart, which apparently also killed Zeus.

                            Awakening amidst cracked earth, Kratos finds Zeus' body impaled on a rock, and extracts the
                            blade callously. However, when Kratos tries to leave, Zeus' still active spirit, consumed by
                            some lasting hatred for his 'infidel' son, attacks and apparently drains Kratos of his
                            willpower, his anger, and instead fills him with fear and a sense of loss whilst throwing
                            him on the verge of death. Before dying, Kratos shares a last-minute mental journey with the
                            guide of Pandora, whose spirit lives on within him, and begins abolishing the various things
                            that torment his soul - the very things that the Astral Zeus is using to kill his mind,
                            similar to what Ares once did. Overcoming these hurtles with a feeling of Hope, Kratos
                            regains conscious and his god powers back, and he forces Zeus' spirit back into his body,
                            before beating Zeus to death with his bare hands, ending the reign of the Olympians once and
                            for all as it seems...

                            Athena arrives to congratulate Kratos on his victory and requests that he turn over the
                            power he claimed from Pandora's Box, but he reveals that there was nothing inside. Athena
                            claims he is lying, because when the evils of the Titanomachy were first sealed into the
                            box, as a safety measure, she placed into the box the "most powerful weapon in the world",
                            hope, to counter act the evils. She demands Kratos return this power he obtained from the
                            box that rightfully belongs to her, for now that the world is cleansed by chaos, she will
                            rebuild it under her rule with the power of hope. Athena realizes, however, that when Kratos
                            first opened the box to kill Ares, as the evils infected and took hold of the gods of
                            Olympus, especially Zeus, the power of hope infused itself into Kratos. Hope had been buried
                            deep beneath the anger, need for vengeance, and guilt, and when Kratos had finally learned
                            to forgive himself for his past, he had released the power. Athena again demands Kratos give
                            her the power, but Kratos refuses, and impales himself on the Blade of Olympus. A large ray
                            of blue light releases itself into the sky, giving all mankind the power of Hope. Athena
                            becomes furious, claiming that man will not know what to do with Hope. She removes the sword
                            from Kratos, and departs, telling Kratos how disappointed she is by his actions. He snarls
                            he owes her nothing (a callback to the beginning of the second game).</p>
